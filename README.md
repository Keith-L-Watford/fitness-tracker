# Fitness Tracker

## Description
I was assigned to create a backend (Server, Database with mongoDB, Models, and Routes ) for a fitness tracker application. Currently the application isnt working at full functionality. Theres a bug somewhere in either the model or apiroutes files and I unfortunatly couldnt squash it. Luckily, I did deploy early and I do have a live version up that allows users to post data, however at this time they can not see the data.

## Installation
npm i to install the npms needed. 


## Usage
Click <a href="https://fitty-trak.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to see the deployed application. 

## Notes
As I was saying before, theres a bug somewhere around line 15 in the api-routes.js file. Unsure if its because of my model or if the collection isnt named correctly. 

## Credits
Thanks to Leif and Scott for your patience and helping me in the beginning.
